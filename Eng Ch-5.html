    1. Where in the classroom does Wanda sit and why?<br>
    Answer <br>
    Wanda used to sit in the seat next to the last seat, in the last row, in Room Thirteen. She sat there because her feet were normally caked with dry mud and very dirty. So in order to avoid being laughed at by her classmates, she sat there to hide her dirty feet.<br>
    <br>
    2. Where does Wanda live? What kind of a place do you think it is?<br>
    Answer <br>
    Wanda lived at Boggins Heights. It seems that it was a place far away from the school and also, where there was a lot of dry mud, thereby indicating that it was not a very rich locality.<br>
    <br>
    3. When and why do Peggy and Maddie notice Wanda’s absence?<br>
    Answer<br>
    Peggie and Maddie noticed Wanda’s absence after three days, i.e., on Wednesday because they wanted to be with her for a lot of fun. They waited for her for a long time but she didn't turn up.<br>
    <br>
    4. What do you think “to have fun with her” means?<br>
    Answer<br>
    Wanda was a quiet and shy girl who was ashamed of dust laden feet. The girls used to make fun of her. This gave them a lot of pleasure therefore, they wanted to have fun with her.<br>

    <br>
    1. In what way was Wanda different from the other children?<br>
    Answer<br>
    Wanda was different from other children. She did not have any friends. She came to school alone and went home alone. She always wore a faded blue dress that did not fit her properly. Unlike other children, she did not talk to anybody.<br>
    <br>
    2. Did Wanda have a hundred dresses? Why do you think she said she did?<br>
    Answer <br>
    No, she did not have a hundred dresses because she was poor and wore the same faded dress to school everyday. She had an inferiority complex. In order to hide the complex and impress the other girls, she always said that she had a hundred dresses.<br>
    <br>
    3. Why is Maddie embarrassed by the questions Peggy asks Wanda? Is she also like Wanda, or is she different?<br>
    Answer <br>
    Maddie was embarrassed by the questions Peggy asked Wanda because she was poor herself. She usually wore old clothes, which were handed down by someone else. She did not feel sorry for Wanda. She was worried that perhaps later, everyone would start teasing her too. She thought she was different from Wanda in the sense that she would never claim that she had a hundred dresses. She was not as poor as Wanda. Yet she was afraid that the others might mock her too.<br>

    <br>
    2. Who did Maddie think would win the drawing contest? Why?<br>

    <br>

    <br>
    1. How is Wanda seen as different by the other girls? How do they treat her?<br>
    Answer  <br>
    Wanda is seen as different by the other girls. She is poor and lonely girl. The girls made fun of her poverty and teased her by commenting on her dress.<br>
    <br>
    2. How does Wanda feel about the dresses game? Why does she say that she has a hundred dresses?<br>
    Answer <br>
    Wanda did not show any feelings regarding the dresses game. It is most likely that she was deeply hurt. It could have been one of the reasons why her family left the place and moved to the city.She was a girl who was very poor and came form a long distance which made her feet dirty. She wanted to draw attention of her friends. So, she felt very happy whenever she told her friend that she had hundred dresses without realising that they were making fun of her.<br>
    <br>
    3. Why does Maddie stand by and not do anything? How is she different from Peggy? (Was Peggy’s friendship important to Maddie? Why? Which lines in the text tell you this?)<br>
    Answer<br>
    Maddie always stood by and never did anything as she was afraid that if she did, she would be the next target of the children. She herself was poor and therefore, felt that if she spoke against the others, they would target her next. Unlike her, Peggy was a rich girl. This was also the reason why Maddie could think from Wanda’s point of view, but Peggy could not. Maddie was Peggy’s best friend. It seemed as if she was in awe of Peggy. She admired her quite a lot as she said that Peggy was the most liked girl in the room and that she drew better than anyone else. She did not have the courage to go against her. Some of the lines from the text which show that Peggy’s friendship was important to Maddie are as follows.<br>
    (i) Peggy, who had thought up this game, and Maddie, her inseparable friend, were always the last to leave.<br>
    (ii) She was Peggy’s best friend, and Peggy was the best-liked girl in the whole room.<br>
    (iii) Peggy could not possibly do anything that was really wrong, she thought.<br>
    (iv) Oh, Maddie was sure Peggy would win.<br>
    <br>
    4. What does Miss Mason think of Wanda’s drawings? What do the children think of them? How do you know?<br>
    Answer<br>
    Miss mason appreciated the paintings of Wanda. She was impressed at the creativity of the girl because she had painted hundred paintings which were in wide range of variety.The children also admired the drawings. Everybody stopped and whistled or murmured admiringly. After Miss Mason had announced that Wanda was the winner, they burst into applause, and even the boys were glad to have a chance to stamp on the floor and whistle. Also, just as Peggy and Maddie entered the room, they stopped short and gasped. Later they recognized the designs as those which Wanda had described to them. And in the end, Peggy exclaimed, “…and I thought I could draw.” This shows that she also realized how good Wanda’s drawings were.<br>
