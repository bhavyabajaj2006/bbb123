    Write in Brief<br>
1. Give reasons for the following:<br>
(a) Woodblock print only came to Europe after 1295.<br>
(b) Martin Luther was in favour of print and spoke out in praise of it.<br>
(c) The Roman Catholic Church began keeping an Index of Prohibited books from the mid-sixteenth century.<br>
(d) Gandhi said the fight for Swaraj is a fight for liberty of speech, liberty of the press, and freedom of association.<br>
Answer:<br>
(a) Woodblock print was invented in China around the sixth century. It came to Europe in 1295 when Marco Polo, an Italian explorer, returned to Italy after many years of exploration in China. He broughtwith him the technology of woodblock printing.<br>
(b) Martin Luther was a great religious reformer of Germany. In 1517, he wrote 95 theses that criticised the corrupt practices of the Roman Catholic Church. Very soon, thousands of copies of Luther’s writings were printed and read widely. He was deeply moved by realising the power of printing and was grateful to it. He considered print as the ultimate gift of God. This led to the beginning of the reformation movement. This is the reason why Luther was in favour of print and spoke out in praise of it.<br>
(c) Print and popular literature encouraged many distinctive interpretations of religious faiths.Manocchio, a miller in Italy, began to read the books that were available in his locality. He gave a new interpretation of the Bible and formulated a view of God. Due to this, the Roman Catholic Church had to face many dissents from mid-16th century onwards. Therefore, the church banned such books and decided to maintain an Index of the prohibited books.<br>
(d) According to Mahatma Gandhi, the liberty of speech, liberty of press and freedom of association were three most powerful weapons of expressing and cultivating public opinion. No nation can survivewithout these three prerequisites. If a country wants to get freedom from foreign domination then these three liberties are very important.<br>
<br>
2. Write short notes to show what you know about:<br>
(a) The Gutenberg Press<br>
(b) Erasmus's idea of the printed book<br>
(c) The Vernacular Press Act<br>
Answer:<br>
(a) The Gutenberg Press: It was the first printing press that was developed by Johan Gutenberg. He spent his childhood in a large agricultural estate and had good experience in operating olive and wine presses. By 1448, he developed a modified version of olive and wine presses. With this new printing press, the first book he printed was Bible. This press had a long handle attached to the screw. The screw was turned with help of the handle which in turn pressed down the platen over the printing block that was placed on the top of a sheet of damp paper. The lead moulds were used for casting the metal types for the letters of alphabet.<br>
(b) Erasmus’s idea of printed book: Erasmus was the Latin scholar and a Catholic reformer. He criticized the printing of books because he was afraid that this would lead to the circulation of books that were full of rebellious ideas. He thought that majority of the books were irrelevant and illogical which would only spread the scandalous and irreligious ideas. According to him, with such books coming in large numbers, the significance of valuable literature would be lost.<br>
(c) The Vernacular Press Act: This act was passed in 1878 by the British government in India. This act gave the government with tyrannical rights to censor reports and editorials in the Vernacular Press. If a Vernacular Paper published any seditious report and the newspaper ignored the initial warning, then the press was seized and the printing machinery confiscated.<br>

Encouraged and inspired by the social reformers, the people like factory workers also started setting up their libraries. Some of them also wrote books highlighting the issue of class distinction. In 1938, Kashibaba, a Kanpur mill worker wrote and published ‘Chote aur Bade Ka Sawal’ to depict the links between caste and class exploitation.<br>
