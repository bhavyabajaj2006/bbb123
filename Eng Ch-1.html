    Oral Comprehension Check<br>
    1.Was Lencho surprised to find a letter for him with money in it?<br>
    Answer<br>
    No. Lencho was not at all surprised to see the letter from God with money inside it. His confidence and faith in God was such that he had expected that reply from God.<br>
    <br>
    2. What made him angry?<br>
    Answer <br>
    When he finished counting moneyhe found only seventy pesos. But he demanded hundred pesos. He was confident that God could neither make a mistake nor deny him what he had requested. Therefore, he concluded that the post office employees must have taken the remaining thirty pesos.<br>
    <br>
    Thinking about the Text<br>
    <br>
    1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this? <br>
    Answer <br>
    Lencho had complete faith in God. The sentences in the story that show this are as follows:<br>
    (i) But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a single hope: help from God.<br>
    (ii) All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.<br>
    (iii) “God,” he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year.”<br>
    (iv) He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and, still troubled, went to town.<br>
    (v) God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.<br>
    (vi) It said: “God: of the money that I asked for, only seventy pesos reached me. Send me the rest, since I need it very much.”<br>
    <br>
    2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter ‘God’?<br>
    Answer<br>
    Postmaster was moved by Lencho’s complete faith in the God. So, he decided to send money to Lencho. Moreover, the postmaster did not want to shake Lencho’s faith in God. So, he signed the letter ‘God’. It was a good ploy to convey a message that God had himself written the letter.<br>
    <br>
    3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why/Why not?<br>
    Answer<br>
    No, Lencho does not try to find out who had sent the money to him. This is because he had great confidence in God and never suspected that it could be someone else other than God who would send him the money. His faith in God was so strong that he believed that God had sent him the money.<br>
    <br>
    4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation? [Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected.]<br>
    Answer <br>
    Lencho thinks that the post office people have taken the money. It is the post office people who send the money to Lencho. But, on the other hand, Lencho thinks they have stolen his money. He calls them crooks. Thus there is an element of irony in this situation.<br>
    <br>
    Page No: 8<br>
    5.Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.<br>
    Greedy<br>
    Naïve<br>
    stupid<br>
    ungrateful<br>
    selfish<br>
    comical<br>
    unquestioning<br>
    Answer <br>
    I don't think there can be any such people in the real world. Lencho is literate and yet he dosen’t know how his letter will reach God without any address.<br>
    He probably would be naïve and unquestioning.<br>
    <br>
    6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story: between humans and nature, and between humans themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?<br>
    Answer<br>
    The conflict between humans and nature is shown by the destruction of Lencho’s crops by the hailstorm. As the crops failed by hail, Lencho started feeling sad and gloomy after the storm appropriately projects the conflict of the nature and the man. The Story also shown another conflict, between humans themselves. The postmaster, along with the help of the other post office employees, sent Lencho the money that they could manage to collect. They were not related to Lencho in any manner. It was an act of kindness and selflessness on their part. Even though they did a good deed, Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. This shows that man does not have faith in his fellow humans, thereby giving rise to this conflict.<br>
