However, Anne was able to justify her talkative nature every time she was punished by Mr. Keesing. On each occasion he was impressed by the manner in which she presented her arguments.All these incidents show how lovable and smart Anne was.

    <br>
    5. What does Anne write in her first essay?<br>
    Answer <br>
    In her first essay, titled ‘A Chatterbox’, Anne wanted to come up with convincing arguments to prove the necessity of talking. She began thinking about the subject. She wrote three pages and was satisfied. She argued that talking was a student’s trait and that she would do her best to keep it under control. She further wrote that she would never be able to cure herself of the habit since her mother talked as much as she did. There was not much that one could do about inherited traits. Mr Keesing too had a good laugh reading her arguments.<br>
    <br>
    6. Anne says teachers are most unpredictable. Is Mr Keesing unpredictable? How?<br>
    Answer <br>
    Anne felt that a quarter of her class was dumb, and should be kept back and not promoted to the next class. However, she also felt that teachers were the most unpredictable creatures on earth. Mr Keesing could be termed as unpredictable. The way Anne always talked while the class was going on, any teacher would lose his temper. However, after several warnings, all Mr Keesing did was to assign her extra homework. She had to write an essay on 'A Chatterbox'. In this way, he tried to play a joke on her. Each time that he asked her to write such essays, she wrote very well. She kept countering his jokes. One could not have predicted that he would take all the jokes in the right spirit. Finally, when she wrote an entire essay in verse he accepted her talkative nature and actually allowed her to talk in class. He did not even assign her any more extra homework. That is why it can be said that Mr Keesing was unpredictable.<br>
    <br>
    7. What do these statements tell you about Anne Frank as a person?<br>

    (ii) I don’t want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would, but I want the diary to be my friend.<br>
    (iii) Margot went to Holland in December, and I followed in February, when I was plunked down on the table as a birthday present for Margot.<br>
    (iv) If you ask me, there are so many dummies that about a quarter of the class should be kept back, but teachers are the most unpredictable creatures on earth.<br>
    (v) Anyone could ramble on and leave big spaces between the words, but the trick was to come up with convincing arguments to prove the necessity of taking.<br>

She did not want to write it like others who merely left big spaces between the words to make the essay look voluminous.
