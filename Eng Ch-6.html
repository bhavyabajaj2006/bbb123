    Question 9.<br>
    What did the girls write in the letter?<br>
    Answer:<br>
    Maddie and Peggy wrote a friendly letter to Wanda. They wanted to apologise for their behaviour but they ended up asking her whether she liked her new school and teacher.

The letter was just a usual letter one may write to a good friend.<br>
    <br>
    Question 10.<br>
    Did Maddie and Peggy get a reply? Who was more anxious for a reply? How do you know?<br>
    Answer:<br>
    No, they didn’t get a reply from Wanda. Maddie was more anxious for a reply than Peggy because she was very upset and feeling sad for Wanda. She had assumed that Wanda was deeply hurt so she was not replying and blamed herself for everything. Maddie used to have sleepless nights and saw frightful dreams about Wanda.<br>
    <br>
    Question 11.<br>
    How did the girls know that Wanda liked them even though they had teased her?<br>
    Answer:<br>

    Thinking about the Text<br>
    (Page 79,80)<br>
    <br>
    Question 1.<br>
    Why do you think Wanda’s family moved to a different city? Do you think life there was going to be different for their family?<br>
    Answer:<br>
    Wanda’s family moved to a different city due to the racist and insulting behaviour of students towards Wanda and her brother. They were teased by other students for their funny name and blue dress. Life there in a different city was going to be different because people there did not have such a narrow mind and would not tease them because of their name or status.<br>
    <br>
    Question 2.<br>
    Maddie thought her silence was as bad as Peggy’s teasing. Was she right ?<br>
    Answer:<br>
    Yes, Maddie thought that her silence was as bad as Peggy’s teasing because it is often said that turning a blind eye to a crime is worse than committing a crime. So by being silent she indirectly encouraged Peggy to do so.<br>
    <br>
    Question 3.<br>
    Peggy says, “I never thought she had sense to know we were making fun of her anyway. I thought she was too dumb. And gee, look how she can draw!”What led Peggy to believe that Wanda was dumb ? Did she change her opinion later ?<br>
    Answer:<br>
    Wanda never replied to Peggy ‘s misbehaviour and pranks that she faced everyday. So, her neutral face and unusual behaviour led Peggy to think that Wanda was dumb. Wanda even described the hundred dresses she said about though she wore the same old faded blue dress everyday. But later Peggy’ changed her opinion after having a look on Wanda’s sketches and her gesture of gifting her a beautiful drawing from her collection.<br>
    <br>
    Question 4.<br>
    What important decision did Maddie make? Why did she have to think hard to do so ?<br>
    Answer:<br>
    Maddie decided to go to Wanda’s house with Peggy to apologise and amend for all that had happened but Wanda had left her house with her family. She felt bad because she thought of herself as a coward who did not stop Peggy to insult Wanda. So, she decided to raise voice against injustice and bullying. She was firm of not being a mute spectator anymore.<br>
    <br>
    Question 5.<br>
    Why do you think Wanda gave Maddie and Peggy the drawings of the dresses ? Why are they surprised ?<br>
    Answer:<br>
    When Maddie and Peggy wrote a letter to Wanda, she might have understood their feelings behind their letter and during the dresses game, she had observed both of them. So she requested Miss Mason to give two of her drawings to them and had taught them a lesson of life. Maddie and Peggy were surprised as she gifted them the drawings with their faces.<br>
    <br>
    Question 6.<br>
    Do you think Wanda really thought the girls were teasing her ? Why or why not ?<br>
    Answer:<br>
    Wanda was aware of the misbehaviour of the girls who teased her everyday “but she remained calm. To keep them mum she fabricated a story of having a hundred dresses and sixty pairs of matching shoes in her closet. She taught them a lesson of life by the drawings of the hundred beautiful dresses she claimed to have.<br>
