          Question 1.
          <br>
          Prove that √5 is irrational.
          <br>
          Solution:
          <br>
      </strong>
      Let us prove irrational by contradiction.
<br>
Let us suppose that √5 is rational. It means that we have co-prime integers a and b (b ≠ 0) such that 
<br>
⇒ b√5=a
<br>
Squaring both sides, we get
<br>
5b^2 = a^2… (1)
<br>
It means that 5 is factor of a^2
<br>
Hence, 5 is also factor of a by Theorem. … (2)
<br>
If, 5 is factor of a, it means that we can write a = 5c for some integer c.
<br>
Substituting value of a in (1),
<br>
5b^2 = 25c^2
<br>
b^2 = 5c^2
<br>
It means that 5 is factor of b^2.
<br>
Hence, 5 is also factor of b by Theorem. … (3)
<br>
From (2) and (3), we can say that 5 is factor of both a and b.
<br>
But, a and b are co-prime.
<br>
Therefore, our assumption was wrong. √5 cannot be rational. Hence, it is irrational.
<br>

<strong>
    Question 2.
    <br>
    Prove that (3 + 2)√5 is irrational.
    <br>
    Solution:
    <br>

</strong>

We will prove this by contradiction.
<br>
Let us suppose that (3+2)√5 is rational.
<br>
It means that we have co-prime integers a and b (b ≠ 0) such that
<br>
a/b = 3 + 2√5 
<br>
a/b-3 = 2√5
<br>
a-3b/2b = √5 … (1)
<br>
a and b are integers.
<br>
It means L.H.S of (1) is rational but we know that √5 is irrational. It is not possible. Therefore, our supposition is wrong. (3+2√5) cannot be rational.
<br>
Hence, (3+2√5) is irrational.
<br>

<strong>
    Question 3.
    <br>
    Prove that the following are irrationals.
    <br>
    (i)1/√2
    <br>
    (ii)7√5
    <br>
    (iii)6+√2
    <br>
    Solution:
    <br>
</strong>
(i) We can prove 1/√2 irrational by contradiction.
<br>
Let us suppose that 1/√2 is rational.
<br>
It means we have some co-prime integers a and b (b ≠ 0) such that
<br>
⇒ 1/√2=ab
<br>
⇒ √2=b/a… (1)
<br>
R.H.S of (1) is rational but we know that √2 is irrational.
<br>
It is not possible which means our supposition is wrong.
<br>
Therefore, 1/√2 cannot be rational.
<br>
Hence, it is irrational.
<br>
<br>

(ii) We can prove 7√5 irrational by contradiction.
<br>
Let us suppose that 7√5 is rational.
<br>
It means we have some co-prime integers a and b (b ≠ 0) such that
<br>
⇒ 7√5=a/b
<br>
⇒ √5=a/7b… (1)
<br>
R.H.S of (1) is rational but we know that √5 is irrational.
<br>
It is not possible which means our supposition is wrong.
<br>
Therefore, 7√5 cannot be rational.
<br>
Hence, it is irrational.
<br>
<br>
(iii) We will prove 6+√2 irrational by contradiction.
<br>
Let us suppose that (6+√2) is rational.
<br>
It means that we have co-prime integers a and b (b ≠ 0) such that
<br>
6+√2=a/b
<br>
⇒√2=a/b-6 
<br>
⇒√2=a-6b/b … (1)
<br>

a and b are integers.
<br>
It means L.H.S of (1) is rational but we know that √2 is irrational. It is not possible.
<br>
Therefore, our supposition is wrong. (6+√2) cannot be rational.
<br>
Hence, (6+√2) is irrational.
