If the condition of the pandemic is fine, the Term-1 examination would be held in the school itself but if the condition is not so good then it would be conducted online. The examination will be conducted under supervision of the external centre superintendents and observers appointed by CBSE. The response of the students will be captured on OMR sheets which, after scanning may be directly uploaded at CBSE portal or alternatively may be evaluated and marks obtained will be uploaded by the school on the very same day. The final direction in this regard will be conveyed the to schools by the examination unit of the board. Marks of the Term I examination will contribute to the final overall score of students.<br>
